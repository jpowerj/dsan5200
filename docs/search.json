This course introduces representation methods and visualization techniques for complex data, drawing on insights from cognitive science and graphic design. Students will obtain an overview of the human visual system, learn to use models for data and for images, and acquire good design practices, such as those using the “grammar of graphics.” Students will use common statistical design tools such as graphic methods in Python3, interactive graphic methods such as Bokeh, Leaflet, and NetworkD3, the R package ggplot2, and Tableau. Prerequisites: DSAN 5000. 3 credits."
