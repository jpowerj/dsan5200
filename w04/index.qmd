## Storytelling with Data {.smaller}

* Often, your jobs as a data scientist is to be an effective communicator

* There is more to communication than numbers on a paper

>Data stories appear to be most effective when they have constrained interaction at various checkpoints within a narrative, allowing the user to explore the data without veering too far from the intended narrative.

## Components of a data story
![](img/2023-02-13-12-00-56.png){fig-align="center"}

## Storytelling is abstract

It is **not** merely:

* a technical matter of creating an image

* designing the right chart

:::{.fragment}
Rather it is:

* the broader considerations that impact nearly every decision you make in the way you frame and present a project

:::

::: {.notes}
The story is the culmination of distilling the information and insights gathered through the analytic process

It is often represented by a series of well chosen and developed visualization, but these visualizations reflect
intentional design choices based on your understanding of the data, the story and your audience

## Telling Your Data Story {.smaller}

**Story components**

To tell a story you have to define a story

> A story is how what happens affects someone who is trying to achieve what turns out to be a difficult goal, and how they change as a result

1. Plot: how the story unfolds
2. Protagonist: the main character
3. Problem: a difficult goal for the protagonist to achieve
4. Transformation - the "so what?": how the protagonist changes as a result

## Story linearity

* Whether driven by time or logic, stories are typically is linear

* Beginning, middle and end

::: {.notes}
Every story is linear, with a well-defined beginning, middle and end. However, those pieces don't have to take
equal time. 

Stories have pacing, which creates tension and interest, and makes the storytelling more compelling.

## Traditional vs. Data Stories

## *A*ristotle vs. *B*recht

* Sometimes you **don't want to** "resolve" the tension!
* **Aristotelian** drama: audience goes home "satisfied"
  * The story is wrapped up, all of the loose ends are tied up, and everything resolves (whether in a happy or sad ending)
* **Brechtian** drama: audience is left with discomfort, ambiguity, unresolved tension
  * Sounds like something you **wouldn't** want to do (and you don't, in many cases), but sometimes can be more effective for spurning people to action!

## Standard Infographics {.smaller .crunch-title}

* An infographic isÂ a collection of imagery, data visualizations, and minimal text that gives an easy-to-understand overview of a topic.

<!-- ## {background-image="img/std-infograph.png" background-size="contain"} -->

## Data Infographics {.smaller .crunch-title}

* Data infographics are infographics that rely entirely or mostly on numbers to tell the story. This often includes data viz, such as charts and graphs, but not always.

* Even research poster construction requires a narrative flow!

## Repetition and Redundancy


The old adage on how to present anything:

* Tell them what you are going to tell them
* Then tell them
* Then tell them what you just told them

## Awesome data driven viz narratives

- The New York Times
- Wall Stree Journal
- The Washington Post
- FiveThirtyEight
- The Economist
- [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/visual-and-data-journalism)
- [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/)

## The Pudding's process: {.smaller}

### By Ilia Blinderman
1. Storytelling is complicated
2. Who is your audience
3. Focus broadly or narrowly
4. Complexity of the finding after analysis
5. Progressing through the arguments
6. Arriving at the conclusion
