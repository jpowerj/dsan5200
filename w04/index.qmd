## Humans are wired for stories

::: {.center}
Stories are a survival mechanism across generations
:::

## Data storytelling is essential {.smaller}

* Often, your jobs as a data-scientist is to be an effective communicator

* There is more to communication than numbers on a paper

* Stories are up to 22 times more memorable than facts alone

* When in doubt, tell stories

>Data stories appear to be most effective when they have constrained interaction at various checkpoints within a narrative, allowing the user to explore the data without veering too far from the intended narrative.

## Components of a data story

## Storytelling is abstract

It is **not** merely:

* a technical matter of creating an image

* designing the right chart

:::{.fragment}
Rather it is:

* the broader considerations that impact nearly every decision you make in the way you frame and present a project

:::

::: {.notes}
The story is the culmination of distilling the information and insights gathered through the analytic process

It is often represented by a series of well chosen and developed visualization, but these visualizations reflect
intentional design choices based on your understanding of the data, the story and your audience


:::

## Telling your data story

- Know what you want to focus on
- Don't ignore data that contradicts your story
- Investigate the data
- Discover what stories are in your data

:::{.fragment}

### Story components

To tell a story you have to define a story

>A story is how what happens affects someone who is trying to achieve what turns out to be a difficult goal, and how they change as a result

1. Plot: how the story unfolds
2. Protagonist: the main character
3. Problem: a difficult goal for the protagonist to achieve
4. Transformation - the "so what?": how the protagonist changes as a result

:::

## Story linearity

* Whether driven by time or logic, stories are typically is linear

### Every story has a beginning, middle and end

::: {.r-stack}

![](img/story3.png){.fragment}
:::

::: {.notes}
Every story is linear, with a well-defined beginning, middle and end. However, those pieces don't have to take
equal time. 

Stories have pacing, which creates tension and interest, and makes the storytelling more compelling.

## Standard Info-graphics

* An infographic isÂ a collection of imagery, data visualizations, and minimal text that gives an easy-to-understand overview of a topic.

## Data Info-graphics
* Data infographic are info-graphics that relies entirely or mostly on numbers to tell the story. This often includes data visualization, such as charts and graphs, but not always.

## Repetition and Redundancy


The old adage on how to present anything:

* Tell them what you are going to tell them
* Then tell them
* Then tell them what you just told them

## Awesome data driven viz narratives

- The New York Times
- Wall Stree Journal
- The Washington Post
- FiveThirtyEight
- The Economist
- [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/visual-and-data-journalism)
- [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/)

## The Pudding's process:

### By Ilia Blinderman
1. Storytelling is complicated
2. Who is your audience
3. Focus broadly or narrowly
4. Complexity of the finding after analysis
5. Progressing through the arguments
6. Arriving at the conclusion
