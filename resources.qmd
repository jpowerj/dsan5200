## Wilkinson, *The Grammar of Graphics* (2006)

A key resource for the course, in terms of weaving many of the seemingly-disparate "strands" of the course together, is Leland Wilkinson's book *The Grammar of Graphics* [@wilkinson_grammar_2006]. Since it's extremely hard to find in bookstores and extremely large and difficult to carry around even if you do find it, for educational purposes you can access a <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/5y1kyvbikedswxy3vgywp/Leland-Wilkinson-D.-Wills-D.-Rope-A.-Norton-R.-Dubbs-The-Grammar-of-Graphics.pdf?rlkey=wu63xjp4thninub8k17v5fk41&dl=1' target='_blank'>PDF of the book using this link</a>.

## Nathan Yau, *Visualize This!* (2011) and *Data Points* (2013)

Another pair of resources that we'll be drawing on a lot throughout the semester! Way less technical than Wilkinson, and way easier/cheaper to find at bookstores or online, so I feel much less good posting this one online... But if your situation is anything like mine was when I was a grad student, and you're living off approx. $0 per month of disposable income, here are EPUB copies of both books *(which I am <a href='' target='_blank'>ethically justifying</a> by reference to grad-student-Jeff's experience of professors assigning 5 books/week without a sole PDF or EPUB in sight ðŸ˜µ, along with the fact that all 4 profs for the course are paid subscribers to Yau's blog!)*
